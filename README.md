# lunch

Launch without pain in the a

## Idea

- App for deploying projects from github locally using Docker images.
- Only a Dockerfile is needed in the project you want to serve
- Lunch takes a github link, pulls it, and builds the image
- Serves it locally behind a proxy so the user can configure port/endpoint/host.
- Has a dashboard for monitoring and configuring apps (info, proxy, env etc)
- Cli for quick setup
